## install

type this into your command line:

```
pip3 install git+https://github.com/AgentCreator/Pytisto.git
```

# What is Pytisto?

it is a very simple, very minimalist and very fast python test runner.
I will try to update it daily.

> FUN FACT ðŸ’¡: tisto means "dough" in Ukrainian
## it is a very simple test runner
- import pytisto.
```python
from pytisto import *
```
- initialize the tests.
```python
from pytisto import *

tests([
#     tests will go here
])
```
- create a test group
```python
from pytisto import *

tests([
    test_group("name of the test group", [
        
    ])
])
```
- fill it with ```assert_equals()``` or ```assert_not_equals()``` or whatever else
```python
from pytisto import *

tests([
    test_group("name of the test group", [
        assert_not_equals(2+32, 4, "a message in case of a failure"),
        assert_equals(2+2, 4, "you broke reality")
    ])
])
```
- just run the program.
```

                       TESTS                        

name of the test group:
  \/ passed
  \/ passed

                      SUMMARY                       

tasks: 2
passed tests: 2
failed tests: 0
failed groups: 
rate: 100.00%
```
# **that's it!**
> PRO TIP: if you have a lot of tests, and you only want to see which failed, you can pass in an argument "onlyfails"
```commandline
python3 tests.py onlyfails
```

# NEW: autotests

imagine how cool it would be to have automatically generated tests!

well Pytisto can provide this functionality.

just import ```expr_tests```
```python
from pytisto.expr_tests import autotest
```
and then add the ```@autotest``` decorator!
if you want to compare this function to another, just add the ```ref``` argument and put in the function you want to compare the results with!

your function doesn't work with the number 0? Simple!
just add the ```rand_int_range``` argument and set it to a list of all the possible integers!

your function can only have specific strings? set the ```str_values``` to a list that contains or viable values for strings!

```python
from pytisto.expr_tests import autotest


def say_hello2(to_who, age):
    return f"hello, {age} year old {to_who}! My name is say_hello"


@autotest()
def say_hello(to_who, age):
    # print(f"hello, {age} year old {to_who}! My name is say_hello")
    return f"hello, {age} year old {to_who}! My name is say_hello"


print(say_hello("Bob", 45))

```


## it is a fast test runner

here are benchmarks:

| number of tests | ```Pytisto``` | ```unittest``` | ```codewars_test``` |
|-----------------|---------------|----------------|---------------------|
| 3               | 0.00006008 s  | 0.0000059605 s | 0.02 s              |
| 10,003          | 0.003 s       | 0.010 s        | 90.11 s             |
| 10,000,003      | 8.238 s       | 9.124 s        | 87987.96 s          |

even tho python's builtin ```unittest``` framework wins by a very small amount in the 3 tests, ```Pytisto``` wins in all the others!

**these benchmarks are inconsistent, so you may find different results (I don't think the difference may be bigger then a second)*


**with the third benchmark you may get vastly different results. I have no idea why, but sometimes it is 8.238 s and 9.124 s, and sometimes it is 13.237 s and 15.197 s.*
