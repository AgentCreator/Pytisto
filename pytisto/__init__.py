"""
welcome to my unit test library!
--------------------------------

it is designed to be:
    - simple
    - minimalistic
    - fast

pro-tip:

for better performance, try not just importing "Pytisto"
try importing only the packages you need, for example:

>>> from pytisto import main

or

>>> from pytisto import expr_tests

or finally

>>> from pytisto import  cases
"""
from .main import *
from .cases import *
from .expr_tests import *
